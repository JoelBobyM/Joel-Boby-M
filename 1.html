	<p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the 		production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design 	  include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including 			standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and 	search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams 		covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers 	  will cover them all. The term "web design" is normally used to describe 	 	 the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a 		website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web 		engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are 		expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves 		creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web 		accessibility guidelines.</p>
